# **Slideshow**
Create a simple JavaScript slideshow. This script will allow people to make a slideshow with only using HTML. All of the work is done automatically using JavaScript. There isn't any NPM stuff used here. All you need to do is download the script or link to the script from somewhere and you can use it in your website.

## ðŸ¤“ Example usage
Import the script at the bottom of your HTML:
```html
<script src="./slideshow.js"></script>
```

Here is an example of making a slideshow with 3 images:
```html
<slide-show>
    <slide-show-data>
        <img src="mountains.png" alt="Some mountains">
        <img src="beach.png" alt="A beach">
        <img src="city.png" alt="The city">
    </slide-show-data>
</slide-show>
``` 

## ðŸ˜¤ Planned features:
Here is a short list of features that will be added to the project.
- Text that shows the current index
- Custom button text
- Save slideshow index in localstorage
